So you want to build a Slack app with Node.js? We've got you covered. This package is aimed at making
building Slack apps ridiculously easy. It helps you build on all aspects of the Slack platform, from dropping
notifications in channels to fully interactive bots.

**Upgrading from version 3?** The
[migration guide](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/wiki/Migration-Guide-for-v4) has all the information you
need to bring your app up to speed.

## Requirements

This package supports Node v6 and higher. It's highly recommended to use
[the latest LTS version of node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule), and the documentation is written
using syntax and features from that version.

## Installation

Use npm to install the package and save it to your `package.json`:

```shell
$ npm install @slack/client
```

## Features

The Slack platform offers several APIs to build apps. Each API delivers part of the capabilities
from the platform, with a range of complexity and functionality, so that you can pick the one that
fits for your app.

| Slack API    | Outgoing | Incoming | NPM Package         | Documentation     |
|--------------|:--------:|:--------:|---------------------|-------------------|
| Web API      | ⬆️        | ⬜️       | `@slack/client`     | [Guide](https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/web_api) |
| RTM API      | ⬆️        | ⬇️        | `@slack/client`     | [Guide](https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/rtm_api) |
| Incoming Webhooks | ⬆️   | ⬜️       | `@slack/client`     | [Guide](https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/incoming_webhook) |
| Events API   | ⬜️       | ⬇️        | `@slack/events-api` | [README](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-events-api) |
| Interactive Messages | ⬜️ | ⬇️      | `@slack/interactive-messages` | [README](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages) |

**Just starting out?** We suggest starting at the
[Getting Started guide](https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/getting_started) which will walk you
through building your first Slack app using Node.js.

**Not sure about which APIs are right for your app?** Read our
[helpful blog post](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/getting-started-with-slacks-apis-f930c73fc889)
that explains and compares the options. If you're still not sure,

## Examples

### Posting a message with Web API

Your app will interact with the Web API through the `WebClient` object, which a top level export
from this package. At a minimum, you need to instantiate it with a token. The example below shows
how to post a message into a channel, DM, MPDM, or group. This will require either the
`chat:user:write` or `chat:bot:write` scopes.

```javascript
const { WebClient } = require('@slack/client');

// An access token (from your Slack app or custom integration - xoxp, xoxb, or xoxa)
const token = process.env.SLACK_TOKEN;

const web = new WebClient(token);

// This argument can be a channel ID, a DM ID, a MPDM ID, or a group ID
const conversationId = 'C1232456';

// See: https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage
web.chat.postMessage({ channel: conversationId, text: 'Hello there' })
  .then((res) => {
    // `res` contains information about the posted message
    console.log('Message sent: ', res.ts);
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

The `WebClient` object makes it simple to call any of the
[**over 130 Web API methods**](https://api.slack.com/methods). See the
[guide](http://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/web_api) for details.

### Posting a message with the Real-Time Messaging API

Your app will interact with the RTM API through the `RTMClient` object, which is a top level
export from this package. At a minimum, you need to instantiate it with a token, usually a
bot token.

```javascript
const { RTMClient } = require('@slack/client');

// An access token (from your Slack app or custom integration - usually xoxb)
const token = process.env.SLACK_TOKEN;

// The client is initialized and then started to get an active connection to the platform
const rtm = new RTMClient(token);
rtm.start();

// This argument can be a channel ID, a DM ID, a MPDM ID, or a group ID
const conversationId = 'C1232456';

// The RTM client can send simple string messages
rtm.sendMessage('Hello there', conversationId)
  .then((res) => {
    // `res` contains information about the posted message
    console.log('Message sent: ', res.ts);
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

The `RTMClient` object makes it simple to listen for [events](https://api.slack.com/rtm#events) from a workspace
and send simple messages to a workspace. See the
[guide](http://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/rtm_api) for details.

## Posting a message with Incoming Webhooks

[Incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) are an easy way to send notifications
to a Slack channel with a minimum of setup. You'll need a webhook URL from a Slack app or a custom
integration to use the `IncomingWebhook` class.

```javascript
const { IncomingWebhook } = require('@slack/client');
const url = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL;
const webhook = new IncomingWebhook(url);

// Send simple text to the webhook channel
webhook.send('Hello there', function(err, res) {
    if (err) {
        console.log('Error:', err);
    } else {
        console.log('Message sent: ', res);
    }
});
```
