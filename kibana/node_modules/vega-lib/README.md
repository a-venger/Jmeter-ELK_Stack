# vega-lib

Include Vega in client-side projects using minimal dependencies.

**Vega** is a _visualization grammar_, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega you can describe data visualizations in a JSON format, and generate interactive views using either HTML5 Canvas or SVG.

The **vega-lib** repository packages up the Vega codebase for use in client-side projects (for example, using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)) with minimal server-side dependencies. We exclude [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) dependencies to remove compilation steps and associated overhead.

For more about Vega, including support for server-side rendering, see the main [Vega repository](https://github.com/vega/vega) and [Vega website](https://vega.github.io/vega).
