## 3.3.1
  - Fix: The filter now only calls `filter_matched` on events that actually matched.
    This fixes issues where all events would have success-related actions happened
    when no match had actually happened (`add_tag`, `add_field`, `remove_tag`,
    `remove_field`)

## 3.3.0
  - Enhancement : if elasticsearch response contains any shard failure, then `tag_on_failure` tags are added to Logstash event

  - Enhancement : add 'docinfo_fields' option
  - Enhancement : add 'aggregation_fields' option
