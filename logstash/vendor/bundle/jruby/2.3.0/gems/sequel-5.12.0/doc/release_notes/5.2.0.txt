= New Features

* A pg_extended_date_support extension has been added.  This
  extension adds support for infinite and BC dates/timestamps on
  PostgreSQL.

  The postgres adapter already had a convert_infinite_timestamps
  setting, but it wasn't supported in the jdbc/postgresql adapter
  and it didn't handle BC dates/timestamps.  Setting a non-default
  convert_infinite_timestamps setting in the postgres adapter will
  now automatically load the extension for backwards compatibility.

  The pg_extended_date_support extension by default just fixes the
  handling of BC dates/timestamps.  To get it to handle infinite
  timestamps, you need to choose the appropriate setting for your
  application:

    DB.extension :pg_extended_date_support
    DB.convert_infinite_timestamps = :string # or :float or :nil

  This extension also enables the handling of timezone offsets
  with seconds, which is not natively supported by ruby's Time
  class in ruby <2.5.

= Improvements

* The jdbc/mysql adapter now handles smallint unsigned and
  integer unsigned column types where the value for the column
  is outside of the range of a Java short or integer.

* Sequel::Model.inherited no longer modifies an existing @dataset
  instance variable if one has already been set.  This fixes a
  regression that was introduced in Sequel 5.0.0.
