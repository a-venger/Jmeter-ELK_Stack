## 7.0.3
  - Bugfix: Sends are now retried until successful. Previously, failed transmissions to Kafka
    could have been lost by the KafkaProducer library. Now we verify transmission explicitly.
    This changes the default 'retry' from 0 to retry-forever. It was a bug that we defaulted
    to a retry count of 0.

   with inputs because inputs by default are single threaded. This makes it a bad
   first user experience. Plain codec is a much better default.
