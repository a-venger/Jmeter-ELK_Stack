## 5.0.4
 - Fix bug in parsing headers where certain legal escape sequences could cause non-escaped pipe characters to be ignored.
 - Fix bug in parsing extension values where a legal unescaped space in a field's value could be interpreted as a field separator (#54)
 - Add explicit handling for extension key names that use array-like syntax that isn't legal with the strict-mode field-reference parser (e.g., `fieldname[0]` becomes `[fieldname][0]`).
